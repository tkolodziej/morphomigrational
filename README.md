# morphomigrational
Matlab code for calculation building blocks of morphomigrational description.

How to run it:
1) Add the whole package to the Matlab path
2) Open the MainProgramStartHere
3) Modify Settings, to be suited to your data
4) Go to the folder with binary masks
5) Run the program

Input files: single binary mask in each field of view. Tracking of multiple shapes is not supported.

The functions of other files are commented in the code.

If the problem occur (because of the poor explanation, possibly), you can contact me in the e-mail mentioned in the publication "Morphomigrational description - a new approach connecting cell migration with its morphology" (I'll add the doi if it is gonna be published).
